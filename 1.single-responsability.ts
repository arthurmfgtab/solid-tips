// Every class should have only one responsability

// If a Class has many responsibilities, it increases the possibility of bugs because making changes to
// one of its responsibilities, could affect the other ones without you knowing.

// Goal
// This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it wonâ€™t affect other unrelated behaviours.

// Use custom hooks
// Extract small components off the main one
