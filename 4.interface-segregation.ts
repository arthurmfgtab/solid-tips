// Clients should not depend upon interface that they don't use

// A Class should perform only actions that are needed to fulfil its role.
// Any other action should be removed completely or moved somewhere else if it might be used by another Class in the future.

// Goal
// This principle aims at splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a Class executes ONLY the set of actions it requires.
