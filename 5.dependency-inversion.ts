// One entity should depend upon abstractions not concretions

// This principle says a Class should not be fused with the tool it uses to execute an action.
// Rather, it should be fused to the interface that will allow the tool to connect to the Class.

// Goal
// This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
